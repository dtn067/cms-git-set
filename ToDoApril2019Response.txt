Decisions on April 8th:
1. We will meet weekly on Thursday at 11am, in Igor's office.
2. To do for next meeting:
   2.1 switch to new data that has sitename in it
       - Relevant plots are in 'Results/classads' in directories corresponding
         to the site name
   2.2 High level description of what is in the data tyoum arte working with"
       2.2.3 How many days are covered? From when to when?
       2.2.4 Describe to me the structure of what a ROW means.
             The key for each row is a compund of Day+data_tier+crab_job+input_campaign
             i.e. for each day and each data_tier each campaign and each of two job types (crab True or false) we have aggregated infor for each input campaign.
                - Each row contains information for a given set of jobs
             We agree to require always crab_job==True && data_tier == *MINIAOD*
             
       2.2.4 High level characterization of the data we have to work with in the working_set_day:
             how many days?
                - 1032251 days
             how many input campaigns?
                - 319 unique input campaigns
             how many jobs total?
                - 604617621 total jobs
       2.2.5 High level characterization of dbs_blocks:
             how many blocks total?
             how much data total across all blocks?
             What is the distribution of block sizes ?
             What is the distribution of # of blocks per campaign ? (x-axis is # of blocks, Y-axis is how many campaings have that many blocksd)
             What is the distribution of data size per campaign ?
