Decisions on April 8th:
1. We will meet weekly on Thursday at 11am, in Igor's office.
2. To do for next meeting:
   2.1 switch to new data that has sitename in it
       - Relevant plots are in 'Results/classads' in directories corresponding
         to the site names
   2.2 High level description of what is in the data tyoum arte working with"
       2.2.3 How many days are covered? From when to when?
             - 1089 different days are covered, from 2016-01-07 to 2018-12-30
       2.2.4 Describe to me the structure of what a ROW means.
             The key for each row is a compund of Day+data_tier+crab_job+input_campaign
             i.e. for each day and each data_tier each campaign and each of two job types (crab True or false) we have aggregated infor for each input campaign.
                - Each row contains information (of block use) for a given set 
                  of jobs
             We agree to require always crab_job==True && data_tier == *MINIAOD*
             
       2.2.4 High level characterization of the data we have to work with in the working_set_day:
             how many days?
                - There are 999 unique days on which blocks are accessed in the 
                  working_set_day (spanning the set of days that are covered)
             how many input campaigns?
                - 319 unique input campaigns
             how many jobs total?
                - 604617621 total jobs
       2.2.5 High level characterization of dbs_blocks:
             how many blocks total?
                - 8935351
             how much data total across all blocks?
                - 361.268 PB
             What is the distribution of block sizes ?
             What is the distribution of # of blocks per campaign ? (x-axis is # of blocks, Y-axis is how many campaings have that many blocksd)
             What is the distribution of data size per campaign ?
