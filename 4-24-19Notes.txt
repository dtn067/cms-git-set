2.1 Characterize the data you work with

2.2 "Working Set vs Time"
    For MINIAOD <-- Data from detector, MINIAODSIM <-- Data from simulation
    && CRAB_jobs <-- tool that analysis is being done with
2.3 "Change in working set vs time" (for the same formats)
    Interested in the daily changes
    Change of the sum (for two weeks) by moving the period by one day
    Two plots: One that shows the (old) data being removed and one that
               shows the (new) data being added

Make presentations of what I've been asked to do with judgement
Spend more time justifying the results

Template for a Talk:
1. Outline of purpose
2. Pointer to Past Results (where to find previous stuff and how current 
   results relates to previous results)
3. For every slide:
    Plot/Table
    Definition of what it is (x, y axis)
    Conclusion Sentence/paragraph

Fix Plots -
